# File Search Enhancement Guide

## Current File Search Capabilities ‚úÖ

Your Memory Vault now has enhanced file search that works for files without embeddings:

### 1. **Filename Search**
- Search by complete or partial filename
- Example: "CDH0301" will find "CDH0301.png"

### 2. **File Extension Search**
- Search by file type
- Example: "png", "jpg", "mp4" will find files with those extensions

### 3. **File Type Search**
- Search by category
- Example: "image" or "video" will find files of that type

### 4. **Code/Pattern Search**
- Detects alphanumeric codes in filenames
- Example: "CDH0301", "ABC1234", etc.

### 5. **Smart Sorting**
- Exact matches appear first
- Then partial matches
- Newest files prioritized

## Search Tips for Files üìã

### Best Practices:
1. **Use specific terms**: "CDH0301" is better than "CDH"
2. **Search file extensions**: Use "png", "jpg", "pdf", etc.
3. **Use file codes**: Most document codes are searchable
4. **Try partial names**: Search works with partial filenames

### Example Searches:
- `CDH0301` ‚Üí Finds "CDH0301.png"
- `invoice` ‚Üí Finds files with "invoice" in name
- `jpg` ‚Üí Finds all JPEG images
- `2025` ‚Üí Finds files with 2025 in filename
- `receipt` ‚Üí Finds receipt files

## Interactive File Results üîß

From search results, you can:
- **View**: Click Eye icon to preview in new tab
- **Download**: Click Download icon to save locally
- **Match Score**: See relevance percentage

## Future Enhancements (Optional) üí°

If you want even better file search, consider:

1. **OCR Text Extraction**: Extract text from images for content search
2. **Metadata Search**: Search by file creation date, size, etc.
3. **Tag System**: Add custom tags to files for better organization
4. **Full-Text Indexing**: For PDF and document files

## Technical Implementation ‚öôÔ∏è

The enhanced file search:
- Searches filename, extension, and type
- Uses fuzzy matching for partial matches
- Sorts by relevance and date
- Handles special patterns and codes
- Shows match confidence scores

Your file search now works great for files like "CDH0301.png" even without embeddings!
