# File Search Integration Guide

## Current Status
✅ **File search functionality has been integrated with the main search feature!**

Your file "CDH0301.png" with metadata about "Rangitha who studies in the codegan" should now appear in search results when you search for "who is Rangitha?".

## What's New

### 1. Enhanced File Upload with Metadata
- Files now include description and tags fields
- Metadata generates embeddings for semantic search
- Rich upload modal with file preview

### 2. Integrated Search Experience
- File results appear alongside memory results
- AI answers include file context
- Semantic search using embeddings

### 3. Database Schema Updates
The following fields have been added to the files table:
- `description` (text) - File description for context
- `tags` (text[]) - Array of tags for categorization
- `embedding` (vector) - Embeddings for semantic search

## Database Migration Required

**⚠️ Important: You need to apply the database migration to enable file search.**

### Option 1: Apply Migration via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250806210000_enhance_files_metadata.sql`
4. Execute the SQL

### Option 2: Apply Migration via Browser Console
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Copy and paste the migration script from `src/migration.js`
5. Run `applyFileMetadataMigration()`

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Upload a New File with Metadata
1. Go to Files page
2. Click "Upload File"
3. Select an image or video
4. Fill in the metadata form:
   - **Name**: CDH0301.png
   - **Description**: Rangitha who studies in the codegan
   - **Tags**: student, codegan, Rangitha

### 2. Test Search Functionality
1. Go to Search page
2. Search for: "who is Rangitha?"
3. You should see:
   - AI answer mentioning the file information
   - File result showing CDH0301.png with metadata
   - Memory results (if any)

### 3. Verify File Search Features
- Search by file name: "CDH0301"
- Search by description content: "codegan"
- Search by tags: "student"
- Search by person name: "Rangitha"

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Search Flow
1. **Query Processing**: User enters search query
2. **Embedding Generation**: Query converted to vector embedding
3. **Parallel Search**: 
   - Memory search using `search_memories()` function
   - File search using `search_files()` function
4. **Result Combination**: Both results merged and sorted by relevance
5. **AI Answer Generation**: Context from both memories and files used
6. **Unified Display**: Single search results page shows all relevant information

### File Search Algorithm
- **Primary**: Vector similarity search using embeddings
- **Fallback**: Text-based search on name, description, and tags
- **Threshold**: 0.3 similarity for better recall
- **Context**: File metadata included in AI answer generation

## Expected Behavior

When you search for "who is Rangitha?":

**Before Integration:**
- Only showed memory results
- File information was invisible to search

**After Integration:**
- AI Answer: "Based on your files, Rangitha is someone who studies in the codegan (File: CDH0301.png)"
- File Results: Shows CDH0301.png with description and tags
- Memory Results: Any relevant memories about Rangitha

## Troubleshooting

### If file search doesn't work:
1. ✅ Check migration was applied successfully
2. ✅ Verify file has metadata (description/tags)
3. ✅ Ensure file has embedding generated
4. ✅ Try different search terms
5. ✅ Check browser console for errors

### If AI doesn't mention files:
1. ✅ Verify file results appear in search results
2. ✅ Check file similarity score (should be > 0.3)
3. ✅ Ensure file metadata is descriptive

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the database migration** (required)
2. **Re-upload your file** with proper metadata
3. **Test the search functionality**
4. **Enjoy seamless file discovery** through natural language search!

The integration is now complete and your files will be as searchable as your memories! 🎉
