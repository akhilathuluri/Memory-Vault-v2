# 🔧 Startup Lock Issue - Fixed

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

After unlocking, the vault was immediately locking again with reason "startup" because:

1. **Multiple Initializations**: `SecurityStore.initialize()` was being called multiple times
2. **Service Re-initialization**: Each call triggered `SecurityService.initialize()`
3. **Startup Lock**: Service always locked on initialization
4. **Multiple Callbacks**: State change callbacks were registered multiple times

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Prevent Multiple Store Initializations**
- Added `isInitialized` flag to SecurityStore
- Skip initialization if already completed
- Prevents redundant service calls

### **2. Prevent Multiple Service Initializations**
- Added `isInitialized` flag to SecurityService
- Only lock on startup during first initialization
- Skip startup lock on subsequent calls

### **3. Single State Change Callback**
- Check if callback already registered before adding new one
- Prevents multiple duplicate callbacks
- Reduces console spam

### **4. Better Logging**
- Track initialization attempts
- Log when skipping redundant calls
- Clear debugging information

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Expected Behavior**
1. **First Load**: Vault locks on startup (if enabled)
2. **After Unlock**: Vault stays unlocked
3. **No Re-initialization**: Service doesn't re-initialize after unlock
4. **Clean Logs**: No duplicate state change notifications

### **Console Logs to Watch For**
**✅ Good (First time):**
```
🔧 SecurityStore: Starting initialization
🔧 SecurityService: Initialize called, isInitialized: false
🔒 SecurityService: First initialization - locking on startup
🔧 SecurityStore: State change callback registered
```

**✅ Good (Subsequent calls):**
```
🔧 SecurityStore: Already initialized, skipping
🔧 SecurityService: Already initialized - skipping startup lock
```

**❌ Bad (Should not see after fix):**
```
🔒 SecurityService: Locking vault with reason: startup (after unlock)
Multiple duplicate state change notifications
```

## 🔍 **Debug Commands**

Test in browser console:
```javascript
// Check initialization state
const store = useSecurityStore.getState();
console.log('Store initialized:', store.isInitialized);

// Check service state
const service = SecurityService.getInstance();
console.log('Service initialized:', service.isInitialized);
```

## 🎯 **Expected Flow After Fix**

### **App Startup**
1. SecurityStore initializes (once)
2. SecurityService initializes (once)
3. Vault locks on startup (if enabled)
4. State change callback registered (once)

### **After Unlock**
1. User unlocks successfully
2. No re-initialization occurs
3. Vault stays unlocked
4. Activity monitoring continues normally

### **Component Remounts**
1. useVaultLock hook calls initialize
2. SecurityStore sees isInitialized=true
3. Skips initialization
4. No service calls made

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

When working correctly:
1. **Single Initialization**: Only happens once per session
2. **No Startup Lock After Unlock**: Vault stays unlocked
3. **Clean Console**: No duplicate state notifications
4. **Stable State**: Consistent behavior across component mounts

The startup lock loop should now be completely resolved! 🔐✨
